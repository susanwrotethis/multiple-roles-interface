#. Description of the plugin
msgid ""
"WordPress supports multiple roles for users but does not have an interface "
"to manage them. Multiple Roles Interface replaces the Roles dropdown on the "
"user-edit.php and user-new.php pages with a list of checkboxes so more than "
"one role may be assigned to a user. Works on multisite."
